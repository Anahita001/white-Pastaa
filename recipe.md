In this recipe we will learn how to make White Pasta, that is an Italian dish . So lets begin 

LETS GET STARTED --------::::::::::::----------

   STEP 1) First take a vessel and boil water in it. Once it is Boiled add Pasta ,salt and oil in it.
           Boiling is necessary so that Pasta gets soft and chubby. We added salt in it because when we boil 
           the Pasta it is the only time we can flavour it, And now question arises why didn't add any other 
           spice in it??? we didn't added it because salt is the only spice which gets thoroughly mixed
           with Pasta while boiling. We added oil so that Pasta didn't cling with each other.
           
   STEP 2) Take one more vessel and pour 1 tbsp oil in it . Once it is heated add garlic and fry it a little
            We don't have to cook it completely because we have to cook it with Pasta also. And then pour-out
            all the vegetables and sprinkle salt and black pepper. Mix it properly and when the vegetables 
            are a little cooked turn the gas off.
   
   STEP 3) Now we will make White Sauce and mix all the vegetables and Pasta . For white sauce first cut
            cube of 200 g from buter and put it in vessel. When the butter start melting pour out 
            2 big spoons of Maida. and mix it. When the Maida is cooked start adding milk slowly slowly
            so that it can be cooked easily . Now your sauce is ready.Add salt and Black Pepper. Also add 
            oregano and chilli flakes. If you don't have oregano nd chilli flakes skip it. Now add Vegetables
            in it and cook for 1 min . and then immediately add pasta and mix it well. Cook for 1 min and 
            then turn the gas off.

   STEP 4) Your tasty White Pasta is ready. Serve it in plate and enjoy !!!!!!!
